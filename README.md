## Hello, World! 👋

I'm Yuya Matsuo, but you can call me "niu" or "メタルおじさん". I'm a Software Engineer who loves to compose music and write code that rocks as hard as my guitar riffs. Born in the late '80s, I've been debugging since the days of dial-up internet.

### Fun Facts:
- My favorite IDE is Android Studio, and yes, I do talk to it sometimes.
- I believe in the power of Kotlin and the magic of coroutines.
- Heavy Metal is my jam, and so is a well-optimized RecyclerView.
